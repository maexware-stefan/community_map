# OXID Community Map

A map stuffed with peeps being involved in [OXID eShop](https://oxidforge.org) development. The directory is hosted on GitHub and hence allows everyone to add, delete or alter its own entry. ♥ Join us!

The screen shot above shows what user entries look like. You’ll even get your own URL for your entry - awesome, isn't it? For example, this is a [link to Chris](https://oxidprojects.github.io/community_map/#code-commerce).

## How to add and manage your entry?

You can add your own marker to the map and manage your data yourself. Learn about it at [3 ways how to manage your entry](https://github.com/OXIDprojects/community_map/tree/master/_directory)!

## Who’s the map for?

The map is for any person to be involved with OXID eShop development: developers, integrators, editors, translators, designers, etc. It’s about visualizing the OXID community. If you use or support OXID, the map is for you!
